## Overview
I wanted to challenge myself by using both flexbox and grid on the same project, so working on this was very interesting. I used flexbox for the mobile design and and grid for desktop. I think I got the mobile design perfectly using flexbox. The grid on the desktop design was a little tricky (Still a little bit new to grid). I found it a bit hard placing each of the items where I wanted them until I figured out how to do them using grid area which was pretty cool. The only issue I had is that the last item on the right is overlapping a bit and I'm not sure how to fix it.
The other issue I had is with reducing the space between the reviewer's name and 'verified graduate'. I think this was probably because I used figcaption for the name and span for the 'verified graduate'. I'm not yet sure how to figure that out. 
I added one other cool think to the design though which is transition. I've always thought those were cool. I'm pretty proud of this. I'd like your suggestions on how to improve on these flaws please.:)
